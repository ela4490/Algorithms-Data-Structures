# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains java solutions for the various problems which are based algorithms and data structures from platforms like Hacker Rank, Leet Code, Hacker Earth, Geeks For Geeks and Code Chef.

Note : Since, I did these questions on the online platforms, few solution contains only the logic for the class.
In some cases, you might need to add Main Class in the solution files in order to execute them properly in IDE.
